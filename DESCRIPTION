Title: String Patterns and Statistical Differences Between Two Groups
        of Strings
Description: Methods include converting series of event names to strings, finding common patterns
    in a group of strings, discovering "unique" patterns when comparing two groups of strings as well
    as the number and starting position of each pattern in each string, obtaining transition matrix, 
    computing transition entropy, statistically comparing the difference between two groups of strings,
    and clustering string groups. Event names can be any action names or labels such as events in log files or areas of interest (AOIs) in eye tracking research.
